# Wordle-v1
1st Project

6 attempts to guess a 5 letter word
if letter is in word and in correct position, letter is highlighted green
if letter is in word but in wrong position, letter is highlight yellow
if letter is not in word, no highlight

~13,000 guessable words but only ~2300 in answer pool
a word/game a day would keep it running with non-repeating answers for 6.3 years. then what?
